This web application allows a user to write a set of rules in plain English and translate these rules into a more specific rule language, one which can be exported to a file and easily imported into an evaluation program. It is intended to be used by any users working with BIM, regardless of their familiarity with the rule language or the ways in which this language is interpreted by external model evaluation programs. This project will serve as an intermediary layer between creating written requirements for a project and evaluation of these requirements in modelling software. Project Glossary Building Information Modeling (BIM) - The digital process of creating and representing buildings and other construction elements using software such as Autodesk Revit. Rule - An individual constraint or suggestion for a building, such as a building code or guideline. Ruleset - A collection of rules, all of which should apply to a building under different circumstances. Design Rule Language (DRL) - The representation of a rule in a more precise format easy to understand and apply to a BIM model. Developed by Christoph Sydora, see his paper on the subject. Types - A component of a rule in Christoph's rule language. Types are the different kinds of objects which exist within a building. For example, walls, sinks, cabinets, and so on. Units - A component of a rule in Christoph's rule language. Units are any measure, such as distance, weight, volume, and so on. Relations - A component of a rule in Christoph's rule language. Relations are the connection between different types in the rule. For example, the keyword BETWEEN might be a relation limitation between two different types. Properties - A component of a rule in Christoph's rule language. Properties are the inherent values of each member of a type. For example, a sink might be required to be of a certain length to pass the rule.

Functionally very different (actually a live demo of RITA, which can be found here ). However, this live demo has a UI that achieves much of what we are aiming to do. It takes input in, analyzes it, and prints JSON output on the same page. We could also potentially use the RITA language itself in this project. I have not determined if this is practical or not. Open-Source Products FRET: Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool Requirements elicitation tool for entering requirements into a domain-specific rule language Highlights words in different colours corresponding to the different parts of a requirement as parsing occurs Allows for creation of rules in rulesets Text is entered in a mixture of natural language and domain-specific language terms, so parsing is somewhat similar but not the same as what we intend to do.

In2sql Tool to convert natural language into SQL queries Not in the domain of our project, but SQL query translation shares similarities with what we are aiming to accomplish Given an SQL database dump, a selected language, and input phrase, outputs an SQL query to match this phrase. While this tool is limited in terms of parsing ability (it does not recognize plural versus singular, and specific key phrases are somewhat required), it does use a customizable thesaurus file for the given language being used to allow for improved recognition if a specific phrase is not being recognized properly.","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"Requirements/#project-overview","text":"This project is intended to allow easier customization of rules and regulations to be evaluated against a Building Image Modelling (BIM) model, a task which as of now requires intimate familiarity with the syntax required for these rules to be evaluated by external programs.
